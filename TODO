## Code
* Beef up utils, move minimum finding to utils

## Input Manipulation:


## Noise:
* Find noise limit for combined images.
* See if noise in higher components of the FFT correlates to maximum reconstruciton resolution.

# Future:
* Try to align individual slices of sinogram.


# Completed:
* Test to see if np.real(fft_odd) reaches a minimum when the detector is aligned.
* Test on real data.
* Test on sinogram where object is larger than detector frame.
* See if large deviations in "even real fourier component(s)" correspond to deviations in "odd imag fourier component(s)"
